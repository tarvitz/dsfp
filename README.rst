* DSFP means Darksouls Save File Parser.
* `Dark Souls <http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Souls>`_ is game of
  Namco Bandai with pretty hard to get it finished without being killed.
  Lot's of death, fun and broken gamepads/keyboards.

**DSFP** *serves* for getting/fetching your saved characters statistics purposes.

    :depth: 2

**!!!Note!!!** that this repository has pretty much data about internal save file infrastructure and its design. Thouhg everything stored inside 010 editor templates. If you need to process through dark souls save file and make it dynamicly you'd probably need to build your own library based on discovered knowledge. Don't rely that python library someday could even appear ;)

Original source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Original source and some key knowledge were taken from this
`gist <https://gist.github.com/infausto/8382836/>`_.

Common features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supports fetching data about character's death, his/her general stats, hp and stamina.
Whole bunch of reversed stats you can see in datasheet document which is placed
`here <docs/datasheet.rst>`_

(*Help for reverse engineering DarkSouls save file is appreciated*).

Binary Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since May 02 2015 I use binary templates for further save format investigations
and to make reverse engineering work much easier. Common documentation that
have been written in 2014 has some wrong information about different places.
Use `010editor <http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/>`_ to process Dark Souls
save file with given templates.

Works proper with 6.0.x versions, (5.0 on current master branch could have
some flaws in file read process)

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
For general installation you would probably need virtual environment with pip
installed:

Python 2.7
``````````
.. code-block:: bash

   user@localhost$ virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
   user@localhost$ source venv/bin/activate
   user@localhost$ pip install -r requirements/base.txt

*optional*

.. code-block:: bash

   user@localhost$ pip install -r requirements/docs.txt

Python 3.x
``````````
document build requirements stored in py3.txt

.. code-block:: bash
   user@localhost$ virtualenv --no-site-packages venv3
   user@localhost$ source venv3/bin/activate
   user@localhost$ pip install -r requirements/py3.txt

Dependencies
------------
* python 2.7
* python 3.3
* python 3.4


Tests
~~~~~
Simply run ``python setup.py test`` or
You could run tests via `python -m unittest module` or via `run_tests.sh` script

.. code-block:: bash

   user@localhost$ ./run_tests.sh tests.TestDSFPReader

Fast Usage
~~~~~~~~~~
You can parse Dark Souls save files and get data in standard python
dictionary format

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import dsfp
    >>> ds = dsfp.DSSaveFileParser('saves/DRAKS0005.sl2')
    >>> data = ds.get_stats()
    >>> data
    [{
        'attunement': 8, 'body': 0, 'class': 0, 'color': 0, 'deaths': 0,
        'dexterity': 13, 'earned': 60, 'endurance': 12, 'face': 0, 'faith': 9,
        'gift': 0, 'hairs': 0, 'hp': 594, 'hp2': 594, 'hp_current': 594,
        'humanity': 0, 'intelligence': 9, 'level': 4,
        'male': False,  # False means female
        'name': u'TEST_2', 'resistance': 11, 'souls': 60, 'stamina': 95,
        'stamina2': 95, 'stamina3': 95, 'strength': 13,
        'time': 62, # in seconds
        'vitality': 11
       }]


Datasheets
~~~~~~~~~~
There's no many information about Dark Souls save file format (as well as the
other games), so there's not much complete around its format.
Some knowledge represented `here <docs/datasheet.rst>`_.

Please notify me here or by email (tarvitz [at] blacklibrary.ru)
if you have something interesting around whole file format.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whole bunch of the docs you can read by clicking this link
`dsfp.readthedocs.org <http://dsfp.readthedocs.org>`_


Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Huge buch of data now represented in datasheets are still not covered in
    dsfp "api" just cause whole file-format and its datasheet is the main priority.
    You can use it for build your own parser or just read some non-random data
    from *.sl2 files.
    Though dsfp is not complete as it should, please search/read information in
    the docs mentioned above.

Roadmap
~~~~~~~
**!!!Note!!!** there's no commitment that I'll do it someday. Just a simple plan if I get back to darksouls file format for any reason.

I have no certain roadmap for this project and I inspect the data whenever I want
to do it. In general these moments could be very short/long from time to time. So don't
expect me finishing this work to some certain moment or something clear enough.

Use ``./scripts/watcher.py`` and the other scripts (or may be another methods) to inspect
data you need, contact me if you want to share them and have fun ;).

Watching
~~~~~~~~
Use ``scripts/spy.py`` for watching some blocks of data (could be slow for present moment)

.. code-block:: bash

  (ve)tarvitz@mebook dsfp $ python ./scripts/spy.py -f remote/draks0005.sl2 -w json/watch.json
